          This year (2017), for the first time ever, I decided to make Christmas cards. I’ve just finished my first quarter of graduate school in computer science, as well as my first time living off of the west coast. Naturally, my mind is humming with the machinery of graph theory and longing for my various homes in the West. Taking a page out of Dear Data’s book I decided to engage in some Data Naturalism (a slightly reformatted version of the term data humanism, as the work conducted in this spirit is more closely aligned with the notions of self observation found in Emerson’s transparent eyeball). Below you will find a number of postcard sized prints of the adjacency graphs for these various locations.

          These spaces probably don’t mean anything to you (unless you were there with me), which is intentional. Tufte likes to talk about a notion of a SuperGraphic, which is a graphic with a rich data density that provides “super” interesting information, which is generally enriched by being directly relevant to the reader. The example I’ve heard him tote is a map of fire in your neighborhood. This type of graphic allows the reader to find themselves and measure familiar quantities against the information being presented. Quite similarly these cards are meant to be richly interesting to people who live/d in these spaces.
