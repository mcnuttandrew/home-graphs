# city-size

This is the repo for generating my infographic "On the shape of american cities I/II". 
It uses react, react-vis, react-router. 
It has quite a number of scripts for collecting data from various sources.

The main data in the project was curated from 
- Wikipedia (List of most populus cities)
- Google (Elevations)
- Emporis (maximum building heights)
Though there is ancillary data strewn throughout.
